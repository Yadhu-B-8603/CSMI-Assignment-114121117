This assignment contain 2 questions:
# 1. A popular children’s riddle is “Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man’s father is my father’s son.” Use the rules of the family domain to find who that man is using a Prolog program.

A. This riddle can be solved using Prolog's family domain rules. The key statement in the riddle is:
   "Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man’s father is my father’s son."

   Let's break it down:

  "Brothers and sisters have I none" implies that the speaker is an only child.
  
  "My father's son" can only refer to the speaker himself (since he has no siblings).
  
  Therefore, "that man’s father" is the speaker.
  
  The prolog code is given in the file name Q1


# 2. A man, a woman and two children had to go to the opposite bank of a river using a boat. The man and the woman weighed 80 kg each and the children weighed 30 kg each. Given that the boat can carry upto 100 kg and that everyone can drive a boat, write a Prolog program to find how all four can cross the river with the boat.

A. For the river crossing problem, we need to ensure that the group of two adults and two children can cross the river using a boat that can only carry up to 100 kg.

   Given that:
   
   The man and the woman weigh 80 kg each.
   
   The two children weigh 30 kg each.
   
   The boat can carry a maximum of 100 kg.
   
   We can break down the solution into the possible combinations of people crossing the river, and write a Prolog program to find the solution.
