1. A popular children’s riddle is “Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man’s father is my father’s son.” Use the rules of the family domain to find who that man is using a Prolog program.
A. This riddle can be solved using Prolog's family domain rules. The key statement in the riddle is:
   "Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man’s father is my father’s son."

   Let's break it down:

  "Brothers and sisters have I none" implies that the speaker is an only child.
  "My father's son" can only refer to the speaker himself (since he has no siblings).
  Therefore, "that man’s father" is the speaker.
