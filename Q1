% Riddle: "Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man’s father is my father’s son."

% Fact: John is the father of the speaker (the person who is telling the riddle)
father(john, speaker).

% Rule: To solve the riddle, we need to determine who "that man" is.
% "that man's father" (Y) must be "my father's son" (Z), and Z must be myself (speaker)
that_man(X) :- 
    father(Y, X),  % Y is the father of X (that man’s father)
    father(Y, Z),  % Y is also my father’s son (myself, the speaker)
    Z = X,         % Z must be equal to X, meaning that man is myself
    speaker = Z.   % Z is the speaker (no siblings, so my father's son is me)

% Query: Who is 'that man'?
% To get the result, run the query: ?- that_man(X).
% Expected answer: X = speaker (indicating that "that man" is the speaker himself)
